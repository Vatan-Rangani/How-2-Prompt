# Markdown Basics

## Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text using simple symbols. It was created to help writers focus on content rather than complex formatting. Because Markdown files remain readable even without rendering, they are easy to edit, share, and maintain.

Markdown is widely used for GitHub documentation, academic notes, project reports, blogs, and knowledge bases. Most Markdown files use the `.md` file extension. A major advantage of Markdown is that Markdown content can be converted into formats such as HTML, PDF, and Word documents.

## Headings

Headings are used to organize content into sections and sub-sections. They improve readability and help readers navigate long documents.

Headings are created using the `#` symbol followed by a space. A single `#` represents the main heading, while additional `#` symbols represent lower levels.

```md
# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6
````

Guidelines:

* Leave one space after `#`
* Avoid skipping heading levels
* Keep headings short and meaningful

---

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs group related ideas into readable blocks. In Markdown, paragraphs are created by separating text with a blank line.

Text should be left-aligned and should not be indented, as indentation may create unintended code blocks.

Example:

```
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
```

---

## Line Breaks

Line breaks are used when a new line is needed without starting a new paragraph.

* Two spaces before pressing Enter create a line break (not recommended)
* Using the HTML `<br>` tag is more reliable

Example:

```md
First line<br>
Second line
```

Avoid overusing line breaks to maintain readability.

---

## Text Emphasis

Markdown allows emphasis using bold, italic, or combined formatting.

* Bold: `**text**` or `__text__`
* Italic: `*text*` or `_text_`
* Bold and italic: `***text***`

Examples:

```md
**Bold text**
*Italic text*
***Very important***
```

Use emphasis carefully to avoid clutter.

---

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used for quotes, notes, or highlighted information.

They are created using the `>` symbol.

Example:

```md
> #### Important Update
> - Item one
> - Item two
> *Italic* and **bold** text
```

Leave blank lines before and after blockquotes and avoid excessive nesting.

---

## Lists

Lists present related items clearly.

### Unordered Lists

```md
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three
```

### Ordered Lists

```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

Markdown automatically handles numbering.

---

## Lists with Additional Elements

Lists can include paragraphs, blockquotes, and code blocks when properly indented.

Example:

```md
- Main item
  - Sub item
```

Proper indentation keeps related content aligned.

---

## Code

### Inline Code

Inline code is used for short commands or keywords.

```md
Use the `git status` command.
```

### Code Blocks

Fenced code blocks with triple backticks are recommended.

````md
```html
<html>
  <head></head>
</html>
````

````

Fenced code blocks improve readability and support syntax highlighting.

---

## Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules visually separate sections.

```md
---
***
___
````

Leave blank lines before and after horizontal rules.

---

## Links

Links connect documents to external or internal resources.

```md
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)
```

Use descriptive link text.

---

## Reference-Style Links

Reference-style links improve readability in long documents.

```md
This is a reference link [1].

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit "Hobbit lifestyles"
```

---

## Images

Images are added using syntax similar to links, with an exclamation mark.

```md
![Alt text](image.jpg "Optional title")
```

Always include meaningful alternative text.

---

## Escaping Characters

Some characters have special meanings in Markdown. Use a backslash to display them as plain text.

```md
\* This is not a list item
```

---

## HTML in Markdown

Markdown supports limited HTML for advanced formatting.

Example:

```md
This is <em>italic</em> and <strong>bold</strong>.
```

HTML support varies across platforms and should be used carefully.

---

## Why Markdown Is Important for Prompt Engineering

Markdown remains readable even in its raw, unrendered form, making it easy for both humans and AI systems to understand.

Its simple syntax does not distract from the actual content or instructions.

Unlike HTML or XML, Markdown avoids heavy tags and attributes that clutter raw text.

The lightweight structure makes prompts easier to scan, edit, and maintain.

Markdown requires fewer tokens than formats like JSON or XML to express structure.

This efficiency allows more of the token budget to be spent on meaningful instructions.

Markdown blends naturally with plain language, preserving conversational flow.

Its simplicity makes effective prompt writing accessible to non-technical users.

If you want next, I can:
- Split this into **multiple smaller docs**
- Turn it into a **learning note / study material**
- Adapt it specifically for **prompt engineering notes**
- Convert it into **slides or interview prep notes**

Just tell me what you’re aiming for.
